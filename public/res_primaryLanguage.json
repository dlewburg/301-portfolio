      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Dasha (day-sha) Burgos. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am a Navy veteran and I pivoted to Software Development after serving seven years in the service. There I learned skills and experience in troubleshooting, aircraft, teamwork, and leadership. I now work in an IT Help Desk role in which I have experience in software coaching, admin access, content development, and application troubleshooting. I earned my degree in Criminology, but I knew deep down that I have a passion for coding that began in college. I see the emergence and growth in the development of tech over the years. I want to be involved in this technological revolution that is bound to change the world. I am an agile worker that thinks independently and more than capable of working in a team environment. Through my years of experience, I learned to be agile and adaptable in any environment all-the-while excelling in my job responsibilities. Thank you for taking the time out to visit my profile! ðŸ’•",
